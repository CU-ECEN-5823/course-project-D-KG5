This Low Power Node will contain a myography sensor and a capacitive touch sensor. This will be worn by the subject to monitor a particular muscle and notify the Friend node if it detects abnormal electrical activity. In addition, the capacitive touch sensor will allow the patient to call the physician for assistance, or allow a player to alert the coach that they are beginning to fatigue and need to rest. 
The device will remain in the lowest power mode possible, waking to take electrical activity measurements and touch sensor states when requested to by the friend node as well as display it on the LCD display.
